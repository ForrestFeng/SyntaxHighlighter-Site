<p><strong>SyntaxHighlighter helps developers to display code on their website.</strong> Just like what you see above!</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<pre class="brush:csharp">
    string url = "&lt;a href=\"" + someObj.getUrl() + "\" target=\"_blank\">";

    // single line comments
    // second single line
    override protected void OnLoad(EventArgs e)
    {
        if(Attributes["class"] != null)
        {
            //_year.CssClass = _month.CssClass = _day.CssClass = Attributes["class"];
        }
        base.OnLoad(e);
    }
</pre>

<h3 id="how-does-it-work-">How does it work?</h3>
<p>SyntaxHighlighter runs in the browser which means it doesn&#39;t care what kind of server you have.
In fact, SyntaxHighlighter can run locally on your computer without any web server at all and
best of all it runs in virtually <a href="compatabilitychart.html">every modern web browser</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-that-mean-for-you-">What does that mean for you?</h3>
<p>That means you can install SyntaxHighlighter in your home page, blog, CMS, documentation CD
or any other web page. It literally takes just a couple of minutes to get going and you will
have beautifully highlighted code for all your users to admire.</p>
