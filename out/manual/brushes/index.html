<p>SyntaxHighlighter uses separate syntax files called <strong>brushes</strong> to define its highlighting functionality.</p>

<h3 id="don-t-see-yours-">Don&#39;t see yours?</h3>
<p>If you don&#39;t see a brush for a syntax you are interested in, you have a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the <a href="http://www.undermyhat.org/blog/2009/09/list-of-brushes-syntaxhighligher/">List of All Known Available Custom Brushes</a>,
which includes many brushes that did not (yet) make it to the standard distribution.</li>
<li>Check <a href="http://www.undermyhat.org/blog/2009/09/list-of-brushes-syntaxhighligher/#wishes">this wishlist</a>,
and vote for it, in case your brush is already wished for before.</li>
<li>You can request a brush for your favorite language at the <a href="/forums">forums</a> or
<a href="http://www.undermyhat.org/blog/2009/09/list-of-brushes-syntaxhighligher/#comments">vote for it</a> (by adding
a comment) on that same long list.</li>
<li>You can create a brush yourself, see this <a href="/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/brushes/custom.html">handy custom brush guide</a>. Once you do, it&#39;d
be nice to <a href="/forums">hear from it on the forums</a> and/or submit it to
the <a href="http://www.undermyhat.org/blog/2009/09/list-of-brushes-syntaxhighligher/">long list</a> for others to use
as well.</li>
</ul>
