* Fixed OSX specific line wrapping image issue.
* Switched to LGPL v3.<blockquote><i>It was brought to my attention that donation clause isn't compatible with LGPL, therefore I elected to sacrifice potential free beer to stay proper open source, which. This of course means that donations are no longer required, but desired just the same (or even more so now because even fewer people will donate).</i></blockquote>
