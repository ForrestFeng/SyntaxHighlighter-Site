### SyntaxHighlighter.Highlighter

This is the main class that performs all the highlighting work and it's the base class for [developing custom brushes](/SyntaxHighlighter/brushes/custom.html). Each brush extends this class and adds its own custom lexicon and rules. Here are the properties and methods of interest: 

<div class="api" markdown="1">
	Name	| Type	| Description
	--------|-------|------------
	[`getKeywords`](getkeywords.html)		| `Function`	| Converts space separated keywords into usable regular expression to match these keywords.
	[`forHtmlScript`](forhtmlscript.html)	| `Function`	| Sets up the brush for html-script functionality.
</div>
