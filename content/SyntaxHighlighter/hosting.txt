## Hosting

If you are using a hosted service (like Blogger), and don't have a place to upload SyntaxHighlighter code, 
there's a **hosted version** available. This wiki is using hosted files as a "proof of concept." 

### Details

The location of hosted files is `http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/\[VERSION]`. You can see all available hosted 
versions [here](http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/). Whenever a new version is published, the older version will 
remain untouched.

### Legacy 1.5.1 hosting

Old 1.5.1 version is available as well at this location: [http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/1.5.1](/pub/sh/1.5.1).
