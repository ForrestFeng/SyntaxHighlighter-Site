## Please Donate

__There's no set amount to donate, but I hope if you are using my work, you'd at least buy me a beer :) Please click [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=2930402) to donate via PayPal.__ 

Many months went into development and polishing of SyntaxHighlighter 2.0 with no promise of reward except for a hope... a hope that others, who are developers themselves, who know the amount of sweat, passion, tears and torn hair it takes to put a product out there for everyone to use at no charge. I ask nothing in return, but maybe you could buy me a beer (if you don't drink - a coffee and bagel will do just fine (but a good kind of bagel, you know... with wonderful stuff inside to make it wonderful, not just butter)).
