As it always goes with open source, you are welcome to use SyntaxHighlighter free of
charge, but I hope if you are using and enjoying my work maybe you could buy me a beer (or if you don't 
drink -- a coffee and bagel will do just fine (but a good kind of bagel, you know... with wonderful stuff 
inside to make it glorious, like smoked salmon... not just butter)).
