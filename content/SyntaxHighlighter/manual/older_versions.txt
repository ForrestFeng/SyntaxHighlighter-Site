## SyntaxHighlighter History

[SyntaxHighlighter][about] project originally started in 2004 by Alex Gorbatchev and has evolved 
ever since. The project has seen some great success and have gained a few big name users over the years. 
From the start it was an open source project and while the core code has seen few contributions and was 
mostly maintained by Alex Gorbatchev, there's been a number of [brushes](../brushes) 
contributed.

## SyntaxHighlighter 2.0

New 2.0 version is a near 100% rewrite of the 1.5 and is backwards compatible with 1.5 via the 
[shLegacy.js](files/shlegacy.js.html) addon. The two new major features are 
[themes](themes) and [HTML script](demo/html-script.html). 

## SyntaxHighlighter 1.5

The original SyntaxHighlighter is still hosted on 
[Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/), however it's no longer an active project.
