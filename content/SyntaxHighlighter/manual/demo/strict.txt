## XHTML Strict

SyntaxHighlighter 2.0 is now 100% standards compliant. Not only the source `<pre />` tags pass 
XHTML strict, but the actual output generated by SyntaxHighlighter is 100% valid. 

__Note__: Firefox Web Developer plugin sends incorrect HTML to W3C validation when using its 
Tools / Validate Local HTML functionality. It seems to be _unescaping_ HTML characters.
